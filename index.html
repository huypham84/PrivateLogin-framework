                <a style="font-style: italic;">PrivateLOGIN</a> is a framework built on Selenium that allows you to perform large-scale automation of website login through an SSO account.

            <p><a style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract.</a> Numerous websites have integrated social login platforms, facilitating users to login with their Facebook, Google, or other social networking identities, commonly known as Single Sign-On (SSO). Undoubtedly, SSO makes it easy for users to log in to multiple websites without remembering credentials. However, it is also important to consider the potential risk of users being unaware of how the identity of their account will be utilized, the development of online tracking techniques, and any potential exchange of information with third parties without the userâ€™s knowledge. In this paper, we first propose PrivateLOGIN, which enables us to perform large-scale automation of website login through an SSO account. We confirm that PrivateLOGIN automatically login to 91.8% of SSO account available websites in Tranco Top 500 sites. Then, crawling Tranco Top 10K websites with PrivateLOGIN, we show that 1,420 sites (14,2%) contain SSO login (Google and Facebook) as of July 2023, primarily on Information Technology and News/Media websites in the United States and the United Kingdom. As the second contribution of the paper, we shed light on characteristics of privacy leakage of websites with SSO logins by setting up measurements in Japan, our findings reveal that most SSO login processes come with online tracking, which may pose risks to user privacy. Despite the convenience of logging in with an SSO account, it is important to be aware of these potential dangers.</p>
